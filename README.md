# Project Snowstorm ‚ùÑÔ∏è

Win UI's greatest war in (milli)seconds!

Project Snowstorm is a chain of scripts that works together to assist you in the SIAK War. It's lightweight, blazingly fast, easy to understand, and doesn't use any browser driver to avoid startup overhead. Snowstorm is ridiculously optimized. It will run even before the DOM tree is rendered in your browser.

## About

### Limits

Snowstorm uses your own existing browser to run. Any browser compatible with Tampermonkey is sufficient, but keep in mind the limitations: 

- **Computer Speed**  
  Snowstorm depends on how fast your computer build the DOM tree, so your computer speed matters.
- **Internet Speed**  
  Snowstorm still depends on how fast your internet sends messages to the SIAK server, so please check your internet connection. It is advised to **avoid** Faculty Intranet because it's shown that intranet connection is less prioritized during SIAK War. 
- **Luck** üçÄ  
  There are tons of factors that will affect your war. So, good luck!

#### Multiple Instances

Since Snowstorm uses your browser to run, you can't participate in the SIAK war in two separate tabs/windows simultaneously. Otherwise, cookies would collide and possibly affect your war. There are two alternatives:

1. Enable Tampermonkey in a private/incognito browser.  
  Incognito has separate storage, so you can have two Snowstorm running in two different windows by utilizing incognito mode.
2. Use a different browser that supports Tampermonkey.  
  Since different browsers have their own storage, you can run snowstorm in various browsers.

### Prerequisites

- **Tampermonkey Browser Extension**  
  Import using [released zip file](https://github.com/dnswd/snowstorm/releases)

### Components

- **Godspeed** ‚ö°‚ö°‚ö°  
  The main script to choose courses and sends data to SIAK server less than 10ms.
- **Refresher** ‚ö°  
  Refreshes page if the server is down or shows an error.
- **TacticalRedirection** ‚ö°  
  Redirect from the welcome page to the course registration page after logging in.
- **TacticalLogin** ‚ö°  
  Automatically login to the SIAK server.

## Usage

1. Find a decent laptop with capable Wi-Fi or Ethernet.
2. Find a place where the Internet speed is stable and fast.
3. Replace `username` and `password` in **TacticalLogin** with your own username and password.
4. Insert your desired course numbers in **Godspeed**.
5. On D-Day, open a tab and navigate to the SIAK server.
6. Sit back and cheers!

It is recommended to not disturb the browser window before finishing the war. This project is merely a helper, you're responsible for your own victory. Manual monitoring and participation are highly advised. 

## Post-war

To avoid so-called ***sekre-magic***, using a website monitoring app is recommended. There are plenty available on the web and PlayStore, or you can use `distill.io` on your desktop by installing it from the extension store.
